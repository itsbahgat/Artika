## Setup âš™
To set up the Artika project, follow the steps below:

### Server
1. Navigate to the server folder.

2. Copy the .env.example file and create a new file named .env.

3. Open the .env file and adjust the configuration variables based on your environment. For example, you need to modify the database connection settings, API keys, or any other environment-specific variables.

### Client
1. Navigate to the client folder.

2. Open the src/environments/environment.prod.ts file.

3. Locate the baseUrl variable and update its value to the appropriate URL where the server is running. For example, if the server is running locally on port 3000, the baseUrl should be set to http://localhost:3005.
